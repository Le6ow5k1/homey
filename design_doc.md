1. Overview

The Project Conversation History feature logs and displays two types of events:
	•	Comments: Free-form text messages left by project members.
	•	Status Changes: Audit trail entries capturing when and by whom the project status was changed (from a fixed set of statuses).

This history will be integrated into the existing project details page. Users will be able to add comments and update the project status through simple forms. The history feed will display events in a unified, chronologically ordered timeline.

2. User Stories
	1.	As a project member, I want to leave a comment
So that I can provide feedback or share updates on the project.
	2.	As a project member, I want to change the project status
So that I can update the project’s progress (e.g., from “Open” to “In Progress”).
	3.	As a project member, I want to view a unified timeline of project activity
So that I can see both comments and status changes in one place.
	4.	As a project member, I want to navigate through past events easily
So that I can review historical activity using pagination or infinite scrolling.

3. Wireframes

3.1. Project Details Page Layout

(Assuming the basic project creation and management views are already implemented, the conversation history section will be integrated into the project details page.)

Header Section
	•	Project Title & Navigation:
Standard header with the project title, breadcrumbs, and navigation links.

Main Content: Conversation History

------------------------------------------------------------
|                  Project Conversation History            |
------------------------------------------------------------
| [User Avatar]  [User Name]             [Timestamp]        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------  |
| Comment: "This project is off to a great start!"         |
------------------------------------------------------------
| [User Avatar]  [User Name]             [Timestamp]        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------  |
| Status Change: Changed status from "Open" to "In Progress" |
| Optional Comment: "Starting active development."         |
------------------------------------------------------------
|                           ...                            |
------------------------------------------------------------

Forms Section (Below or alongside the feed)
	•	New Comment Form:
	•	Text Area: For entering the comment.
	•	Submit Button: “Post Comment”.

	•	Status Change Form:
	•	Dropdown: Predefined statuses (e.g., Open, In Progress, Completed, On Hold).
	•	Optional Text Field: For adding an explanation for the status change.
	•	Submit Button: “Change Status”.

Interactions:
	•	Pagination / Infinite Scroll:
As the conversation history grows, older entries can be loaded via pagination or infinite scroll (using Turbo streams for smooth updates).

4. Database Schema

We will use two separate tables to store comments and status changes.

  def change
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :email
      t.timestamps
    end

    add_index :users, :email
  end
end 

4.4. Sample Migration (Projects)

class CreateProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    create_enum :project_status, %w[open in_progress completed on_hold]

    create_table :projects do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.text :description
      t.enum :status, enum: :project_status, default: :open
      t.timestamps
    end

    add_index :projects, :name
  end
end

4.5. Sample Migration (Comments)

class CreateComments < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    create_table :comments do |t|
      t.references :project, null: false, foreign_key: true
      t.references :user,    null: false, foreign_key: true
      t.text       :content, null: false

      t.timestamps
    end

    add_index :comments, [:project_id, :created_at]
  end
end

4.6. Sample Migration (Status Changes)

class CreateStatusChanges < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    
    create_table :status_changes do |t|
      t.references :project, null: false, foreign_key: true
      t.references :user,    null: false, foreign_key: true
      t.enum :previous_status, enum: :project_status, null: false
      t.enum :new_status, enum: :project_status, null: false
      t.text :change_reason
      t.timestamps
    end

    add_index :status_changes, [:project_id, :created_at]
  end
end

5. Web Pages & User Actions

5.1. Project Details Page (Conversation History Section)
	•	Display:
A unified, chronologically sorted timeline that interleaves comment and status change events.
Implementation Hint: Create a Rails ViewComponent (or partial) that accepts a list of events (each event has a type attribute: :comment or :status_change) and renders accordingly using Slim templates and Tailwind CSS for styling.
	•	Actions:
	•	Leave a Comment:
	•	Form: Simple text area and submit button.
	•	Controller: CommentsController#create
	•	UI Feedback: Use Turbo Streams to prepend the new comment to the timeline.
	•	Change Status:
	•	Form: A dropdown with predefined statuses and an optional text field.
	•	Controller: StatusChangesController#create
	•	UI Feedback: Use Turbo Streams to append the status change entry to the timeline.
	•	Error Handling:
If there’s a submission error, display a clear message inline. Stimulus controllers can help provide instant client-side validations before submission.

5.2. User Actions Flow
	1.	Submitting a Comment:
	•	User types in a comment and clicks “Post Comment.”
	•	A POST request is sent to /projects/:project_id/comments.
	•	On success, the new comment is rendered in the timeline via Turbo Streams.
	•	On failure, an error message is displayed inline.
	2.	Changing Status:
	•	User selects a new status from the dropdown and optionally enters a reason.
	•	User clicks “Change Status.”
	•	A POST request is sent to /projects/:project_id/status_changes.
	•	On success, the status change is added to the conversation history.
	•	On failure, an error message is shown.
	3.	Pagination / Infinite Scroll:
	•	The timeline is loaded in pages (or with infinite scroll using Stimulus).
	•	Each subsequent request fetches older events sorted by created_at.

6. Security Considerations
	•	Authentication & Authorization:
	•	Any user can view and interact with the conversation history.

	•	Input Validation & Sanitization:
	•	Validate presence and length of comment content.
	•	Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks. (Use Rails’ built-in sanitization helpers.)
	
	•	Immutable Audit Trail for Status Changes:
	•	Once a status change is recorded, it must not be editable or deletable.
	•	Ensure that the StatusChangesController does not expose any update or delete actions.
	
	•	CSRF Protection:
	•	Rails’ default CSRF protection is enabled for all form submissions.

7. Performance Considerations
	•	Database Indexing:
	•	Index project_id and created_at fields on both comments and status_changes tables to optimize queries.
	
	•	Pagination / Infinite Scroll:
	•	Do not load the entire conversation history in one request. Use pagination or infinite scrolling to load records incrementally.
	
	•	Turbo Streams:
	•	Leverage Turbo to update only the relevant parts of the page when new events are added, reducing full-page reloads.
	
	•	Scalability:
	•	Anticipate that projects could have thousands of events. Consider caching frequently accessed pages or query results as needed.
	
	•	Optimistic UI:
	•	Consider optimistic UI updates (using Stimulus) to improve perceived performance, ensuring a seamless user experience.

8. Documentation & Testing

8.1. Documentation
	•	Code Documentation:
	•	Aim for clear and self-explanatory code.

	•	README:
	•	Update the project’s README with instructions for setting up the conversation history feature.

8.2. Testing
	•	RSpec:
	•	Write model tests to validate presence, associations, and data integrity.
	•	Write controller tests for CommentsController and StatusChangesController ensuring proper handling of both successful and error cases.
	•	Use feature specs (Capybara) to test the conversation history UI, ensuring that new events appear in the timeline as expected.
	
	•	ViewComponents Testing:
	•	Create component tests for the timeline ViewComponent to verify correct rendering of both comment and status change events.


Conclusion

This design document provides a comprehensive overview for implementing the Project Conversation History feature. By leveraging the Ruby on Rails stack with modern front-end enhancements (Tailwind CSS, Slim, ViewComponents, Stimulus, and Turbo) and robust testing (RSpec), the feature is designed to be secure, performant, and extensible for future requirements.

Developers should use this document as a blueprint to implement and test the feature in the codebase. Further refinements can be made during iterative development and as additional requirements emerge.
